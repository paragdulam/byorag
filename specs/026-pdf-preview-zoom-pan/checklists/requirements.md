# Specification Quality Checklist: PDF Preview Zoom & Pan

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-08-01
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit-clarify` or `/speckit-plan`
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers were needed. Two higher-impact ambiguities (zoom vs. page-scroll interaction; pan vs. text-selection conflict) were resolved via `/speckit-clarify` on 2026-08-01 and are recorded in the Clarifications section. Remaining open questions (exact zoom range, precise performance thresholds) had reasonable, low-risk defaults and are documented in the spec's Assumptions section.
